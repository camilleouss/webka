                  About Qazaq Republic
               </h3>
               <p>We launched in early 2017. We did not have confidence in the quality of the products, so for the first
                  year
                  we
                  worked in test mode.
               </p>
               <p>The very first point of sale was Duty Free in Almaty. Management liked the presentation and packaging
                  so
                  much
                  products,
                  that they immediately bought out half of the stocks at that time. I didn’t think it would go so well,
                  so
                  don’t
                  began to invest a lot in the project. The initial investment was $ 10,000.
               </p>

               <p>Now we have more than 30 points throughout Kazakhstan. We work with the country's top retailers, such
                  as
                  Meloman, Duty Free, Shymbulak, FashionPark, Gazpromneft. During this time, stocks have grown almost 20
                  times.
               </p>
               <p>Some people think that we only sell T-shirts, but in fact we already have 40 items
                  goods.
                  We are developing several directions: not only a clothing line, but also Drinkware. For example, we
                  recently
                  introduced
                  series
                  thermal bottles "Bótelke", which became a hit of sales. In the fall, we launched the Sómke line of
                  bags
                  and
                  they also
                  entered the market well. In general, all of our products sell well, which cannot but motivate.</p>

         <p>In the future, we plan to introduce more assortment. But things are not as simple as they seem. Introduction
            new
            a product is a whole process of several parts. For example, T-shirts come to us from a factory that
            work with
            big brands such as Uniqlo, Levi's. Then a print is applied separately in the workshop. Packages, lids and
            labels for tubes are produced in different factories. As a result, all this is collected into one product on
            our website.

            <p class="page-dark-description">"The idea of our brand is to convey a piece of culture, national identity.
               The uniqueness of our brand is in high-quality presentation and modern style, which is not a shame to
               wear."

            We would rather work with manufacturers who have experience, and focus on the design of prints.
            AND
            this is only the logistics part, and there is also the RnD part when we are looking for packaging solutions,
            creating designs for labels and prints. The process is laborious, but interesting and gives me the
            opportunity to grow,
            v
            first of all, as a designer. But most importantly, we see and feel support among the population and the
            brand
            on the sly
            becomes recognizable. This year we focused more on offline sales, but soon we will launch online
            store,
            which will make it easy to shop, as well as expand the geographic scope of products.</p>

            Now there are many brands on the market with a national presentation and an emphasis on ornaments. We took a
            different path. Our goal
            - to promote the new identity of the country both inside and outside its borders. Therefore, we write
            phrases in English.
            language.
         </p>
         <p>
            By the way, many people think that the word Qazaq is about the nation, but in fact, as Yerlan Karin noted,
            the word
            Qazaq means “free” from ancient Türkic, that's why our prints have a double meaning. This is a play on
            words: Born
            to be Qazaq / Born to be Free. Many foreigners order this particular print, send their photos from
            our sweatshirts or T-shirts. Therefore, I think that through our prints we also promote the country's brand.
